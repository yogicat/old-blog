      <description>100 Days Of Code Day 1 Today&amp;rsquo;s Progress
Studied &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; element and made simple signin page.Inspired by Virgin America Airlines

Thoughts
I was having hard time understanding and using proper form element. I visited the W3c sites and went to so many websites just for looking for the well- designed form. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I know all about the form but at least I am not afraid as I was before.</description>

      <description>100 days of code Main Commitment I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
For the next 100 days I will code and design something new everyday. The project goal is not only to become familiar with html/css/js but also to maintain my design abilities.
Start Date 2018-01-25
Additional Rules  I will tweet about my progress every day (using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode) I will push code to GitHub and Codepen every day.</description>

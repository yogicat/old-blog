      <description>100 days of code Main Commitment I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
For the next 100 days I will code and design something new everyday. The project goal is not only to become familiar with html/css/js but also to maintain my design abilities.
Start Date 2018-01-25
Additional Rules  I will tweet about my progress every day (using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode) I will push code to GitHub and Codepen every day.</description>

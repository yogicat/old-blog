<h2 id="brief-history-of-javascript">Brief history of JavaScript</h2>

<p>I started studying Javascript this week and the background story of development in javascript really got me interested. Most of the info came from the Wikipedia and it&rsquo;s just a summary version for myself.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="javascript-wikipedia">Javascript Wikipedia</h3>

<p>Netscape vs NCSA Mosaic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser)">more about Netscape at Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>NCSA Mosaic was the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in expanding the growth of the nascent World Wide Web. In following year, Masaic Communications was founded in California to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">Mosaic Netscape</a>. (It shared no code with NCSA Mosaic) The internal codename for the company&rsquo;s browser was Mozilla (which stood for &lsquo;Mosaic killer&rsquo;). The first version of the Web browser Mosaic Netscape 0.9 was released in late 1994. Whithin four months it had already taken three-quarters of the browsers market and became the main browser for the internat in the 1990s.
The browser was renamed <strong>Netscape Navigator</strong> to avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA.</p>

<hr />

<p>In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal of embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. Netscape Communications decided that the scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should have a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, Python, TCL or Scheme. To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days in May 1995.</p>

<p>In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with Netscape Enterprise Server.</p>

<hr />

<p>Microsoft released a JScript, a reverse-engineered implementation of Netscape&rsquo;s Javascript.  JScript and Javascript had noticeable differences and that made it difficult for designers and programmers to make a single website work well in both browsers. (this was the early years of the *<em>browser wars</em> )</p>

<hr />

<p>In November 1996, Netscape submitted Javascript to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International">Ecma International</a> to carve out a standard specification, which other browser vendors could then implement based on the work done at Netscape.This led to the official release of the language specification ECMAScript published in the first edition of the ECMA-262 standard in June 1997 with JavaScript being the most known of the implementations.</p>

<ul>
<li>ECMAScript 3 : 1999 Third Edition , baseline for modern day Javascript</li>
<li>ECMAScript 4 : never completed</li>
<li>ECMASCript 5 (ECMAScript 3.1) : one of the most supported versions of JavaScript.</li>
<li>ECMAScript 2015 (ECMAScript 6): 2015, Sixth edition of ECMA-262 standard. major changes and improvements to the ECMAScript specification.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-what-is-javascript">so what is Javascript?</h3>

<h4 id="javascript-is">Javascript is&hellip;</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Multi-paradigm</p>

<ul>
<li><p>prototype-based object-oriented : stype of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing object via delegation that serve as prototypes. Prototype object oriented programming uses generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended.</p></li>

<li><p>imperative programming : a paradigm that uses statements that change a program&rsquo;s state. An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. it focuses on describing how a program operates.</p></li>

<li><p>functional programming : a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.First-class and higher-order functions. Pure functions. Recursion.</p></li>

<li><p>event-driven programming : Flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensors, or messages from other programs.Dominant paradigm used in GUI and others that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>High-level : programming language with strong <em>abstraction</em> from the details of the computer. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency.</p></li>

<li><p>Dynamic programming : high-level programming languages, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation.</p></li>

<li><p>Weakly typed : some programming languages make it easxy to use a value of one type as if it were a value of another type. This is sometimes described as &lsquo;weak typing&rsquo;. &lsquo;strong typing&rsquo; generally refers to use of programming language types in order to both capture invariants of the code, and ensure its correctness.</p></li>
</ul>
